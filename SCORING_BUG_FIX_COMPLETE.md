# Week 5 Chiefs-Jaguars Scoring Bug - FIXED ✅

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** RESOLVED

## Problem Summary

**Game:** Week 5 - Jacksonville Jaguars 31, Kansas City Chiefs 28  
**Winner:** Jacksonville Jaguars (upset victory)  
**Bug:** All 15 users picked Kansas City Chiefs (9 locked, 6 regular)

- **Expected:** Locks should get -2 points (incorrect lock penalty)
- **Actual:** All picks were showing 0 points in database
- **Impact:** 9 users with locks were missing -2 point penalties (18 points total impact on leaderboard)

## Root Cause

The database trigger `check_pick_timing()` was blocking **ALL** updates to the picks table after games started, including legitimate system scoring updates. This prevented the `updateSoloPickStatus()` function from updating `pick_points` when games completed.

### Why This Happened

- The trigger was originally designed to prevent users from changing picks after games start
- However, it was overly restrictive and also blocked system-managed scoring field updates
- The scoring logic in `scoring.ts` was **correct** but couldn't write to the database

## Fix Implementation

### 1. Database Trigger Fix (Migration 003)

**File:** `supabase/migrations/003_fix_scoring_trigger.sql`

Modified the `check_pick_timing()` trigger to:

- ✅ **ALLOW** updates to system scoring fields: `pick_points`, `bonus_points`, `solo_pick`, `solo_lock`, `super_bonus`
- ❌ **BLOCK** updates to user-controlled fields: `picked_team`, `is_lock`, `user_id`, `game_id` after games start

```sql
-- Key logic: Check if only scoring fields are being updated
IF TG_OP = 'UPDATE' THEN
  IF (OLD.user_id = NEW.user_id AND
      OLD.game_id = NEW.game_id AND
      OLD.picked_team = NEW.picked_team AND
      OLD.is_lock = NEW.is_lock) THEN
    -- This is a scoring-only update, allow it
    RETURN NEW;
  END IF;
END IF;
```

### 2. Manual Data Correction

Updated the 9 affected lock picks from 0 → -2 points:

```sql
UPDATE picks
SET pick_points = -2
WHERE game_id = '6d6e0fbf-30a7-486f-8777-bb57e7d7bd42'
  AND is_lock = true
  AND picked_team = 'Kansas City Chiefs';
```

### 3. Enhanced Scoring Logging

**File:** `src/lib/scoring.ts`

Added comprehensive console logging to track:

- Game data (status, scores, winner calculation)
- Each pick's scoring calculation (isCorrect, basePoints, bonusPoints, totalPoints)
- Solo status flags (solo_pick, solo_lock, super_bonus)

This will help debug future scoring issues quickly.

### 4. Enhanced Fix-Scoring Detection

**File:** `src/app/api/cron/fix-scoring/route.ts`

Enhanced the automated fix-scoring cron job to detect BOTH:

- ✅ Winning picks with 0 points (original check)
- ✅ **Losing lock picks with 0 points** (NEW - catches this exact bug type)

The cron now reports specific issue types:

```javascript
issueTypes.push(
  `${incorrectLosingLocks.length} losing locks with 0 points (should be -2)`
);
```

## Validation Results

### JAX-KC Game (Final Check)

- ✅ 9 losing locks: -2 points each (correct)
- ✅ 6 losing regular picks: 0 points each (correct)
- ✅ 0 incorrect picks remaining
- ✅ 15 total picks validated

### Week 5 Overall

- ✅ Checked all 14 completed Week 5 games
- ✅ No scoring issues detected
- ✅ Proper distribution of positive/negative/zero points across all games

## Prevention

This bug will not happen again because:

1. **Database trigger fixed:** System scoring updates are now allowed after games complete
2. **Enhanced detection:** Fix-scoring cron now catches both types of scoring errors
3. **Better logging:** Comprehensive logs make debugging faster
4. **Regular monitoring:** Fix-scoring cron runs automatically to catch edge cases

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `supabase/migrations/003_fix_scoring_trigger.sql` - Fixed database trigger
2. ✅ `src/lib/scoring.ts` - Added comprehensive logging
3. ✅ `src/app/api/cron/fix-scoring/route.ts` - Enhanced error detection

## Impact on Leaderboard

The fix correctly penalized 9 users who locked an incorrect pick:

- Each user lost 2 additional points (from 0 → -2)
- Total leaderboard impact: 18 points redistributed
- Affected users will see updated scores on next page refresh

## Testing Recommendations

When testing in localhost:3000:

1. Check leaderboard to see updated Week 5 scores
2. Verify the 9 affected users show correct point totals
3. Test the enhanced logging by triggering a score sync
4. Monitor console logs to see detailed scoring calculations
